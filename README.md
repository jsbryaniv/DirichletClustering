# Dirichlet Process for Clinical Outcome Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of a Dirichlet process for clustering in the context of predicting clinical outcomes. It includes a model class that samples variables from a posterior given data, employing Gibbs sampling to estimate parameters for maximum a posteriori estimation.

For this work we also created a [companion manuscript](https://jsbryaniv.github.io/dirichlet-for-clinical-outcome-prediction/) where we show how to derive the math and code that underlies this method.

## Usage

We provide an example that demonstrates the method applied to a dataset for diabetes diagnosis prediction.

To run the demonstration:
```bash
python main.py
```
